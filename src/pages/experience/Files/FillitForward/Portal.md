### The Client Portal

The client portal was probably one of the biggest projects that I had to contribute to. When I first started the role, I did not know much about web development, let alone how api calls were made from the front end to the backend using the [Apollo Client]("https://www.apollographql.com/docs/react/"). This project was originally handled by an external software development company and had a lot of deprecated functionality. I was brought in to redesign, speed up and clean up the client portal.

##### Task

The codebase was built on an older version of Node.js (version 16), which introduced technical debt and some challenging code structures. To combat this issue, I first had to identify what libraries were being used. Some libraries included were **Material UI**.
