### The Client Portal

The client portal was probably one of the biggest projects that I had to contribute to. When I first started the role, I did not know much about web development, let alone how api calls were made from the front end to the backend using [Apollo Client]("https://www.apollographql.com/docs/react/"). This project was originally handled by a third party and had a lot of deprecated functionality.
