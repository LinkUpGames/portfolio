As a game developer at Other Ocean Interactive, I played a pivotal role in the development and maintenance of *Project Winter*, a multiplayer survival game. I developed my skills in Unity and programming in C# by creating both impactful player-facing features and internal tools that streamlined the development process.  For example, I built a character and outfit picker tool using Odin, empowering the marketing team to efficiently generate promotional content and drastically reducing their reliance on personal game matches.  This tool allowed for rapid iteration and streamlined weekly content creation, crucial for supporting the game's live service model.

Additionally, I designed and implemented a novel gameplay mechanic: a distraction tool that emits realistic footsteps.  This feature added a strategic element of deception, enhancing the suspense and depth of play for *Project Winter*.  Overall, my efforts contributed to the game's overall success by improving its marketing workflow and enriching the player experience.

Another project that I was involved was creating a website for the **Project Winter** game. This website was going to be used for hosting *Twitch Drops* for every event that the game hosted. This website was made using React and bootstrap for styling the component.
