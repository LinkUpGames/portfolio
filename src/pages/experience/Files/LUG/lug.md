Ever since highscool, I have been developing my own games. I created a small gaming studio called **LinkUp Games**. This gaming studio is the medium in which I release games created in different game engines.

###### Hacker.exe

This was my first game to hit the market, showcasing my early ventures into game development. While the current version is no longer maintained, the project holds a special place for me. It was a valuable learning experience, allowing me to deepen my programming skills and explore key design patterns. Built using GameMaker Studio 2, the game leveraged inheritance and composition to create a modular and efficient design, particularly in the implementation of its diverse "app" functionalities.

###### Ultimate Reality

"Ultimate Reality" arose from the lessons learned during the development of *Hacker.exe*. I embraced a more classic platforming style, incorporating improved design patterns and a stricter documentation process. This commitment to quality is reflected in the current development stage, where a playable demo is available for PC and Android devices. Built with GameMaker Studio 2, a robust engine for 2D platformers, "Ultimate Reality" embodies my dedication to crafting engaging and polished gameplay.
